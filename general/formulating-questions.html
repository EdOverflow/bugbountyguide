    <h3>How do I formulate a question?</h3>
    <p>One skill everyone in the bug bounty industry is going to need is being able to solve problems and formulate questions properly. Try to spend at least a good 15 minutes attempting to solve your problem and figuring out a solution. Then, if you are still unable to find an answer, contact someone you know that might be able to help. When formulating the question make sure to include what you have tried so far while attempting to solve the issue and share any links that relate to your problem. This will not only help the individual you are contacting about your problem, but it will also demonstrate that you put some effort into trying to resolve your problem on your own. <i>"How (not) to ask a technical question"</i> by LiveOverflow is a must watch for anyone that really wants to understand how to formulate a clear question.</p>
